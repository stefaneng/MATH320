% In this journal please reflect on: 
% 1) whether or not you see that you have progressed as a mathematician, 
% 2) some math that you have seen this term (in any class) that made things "click" for you 
%    or that brought together several different areas of your studies.
% * Your journal should be at least a page long.  
% * It should include both prose and math symbols. 
% * The grammar and spelling should be perfect. 
% * Make this your best effort. 
% * This journal grade will not be dropped (the lowest of the other 7 journal entries will be dropped).

%Before I started this class I was was not a mathematician.
%I may have had an interest in mathematics, but nothing like how I ended this semester. 
%Coming from a Computer Science background, I thought mathematics would be a good supplement to my computer knowledge.

Almost everything in this class made things ``click'' for me.
I think what really made a huge difference was the journals we had to write.
I wrote my first \LaTeX paper a week or two before the class started so I thought it would be a nice way to get some more practice with it.
While I definitly got much better at my typesetting, I feel that exploring a new topic every week helped me find a new passion for math.
Reading \textit{One, Two, Three,... Infinity}, had a big on the way I looked at math.
Using this book as my base for many journals I explored deeper some of the subjects discussed.
I read many combinatorics papers and explored some of Georg Cantor's work on cardinality.


% Need an example

All of the topics I wrote about in my journals were discrete topics.
As we progressed into more continuous topics things started to click in a different way.
These last few weeks on analysis made me realize how much I have learned this semester.
Last summer I picked up a cheap copy of ``baby Rudin'' and was in shock at how hard it was.
I struggled through maybe one or two of the theorems and then gave up, putting it away in my bookshelf.
When we started our work on analysis, I took another look at it and to my suprise I was actually able to do some of the problems.
Analysis may not be my favorite subject, but it was a huge leap to be able to understand (some of) ``Rudin's'' proofs.
By the time I get to analysis I am sure that playing around with Rudin beforehand will make the class much easier.


To conclude, this class has more than anything else given me the confidence to pursure math.
