## Goals for the course:  

To receive a C or better in this class a student must demonstrate that he or she is able to read, write, and verbally communicate mathematics.  The student should be able to read about a mathematical concept or proof (of an appropriate level), synthesize the material, and communicate it to other students in the class in both oral and written forms.  The student’s competence in these skills will be evaluated in three forms:  

* Written weekly homework assignments (30%)
* Weekly Journals and groupwork (10%).
* Bi-weekly mini-tests (30%).  
* One Final examination (30%).

In order to achieve the goals of the course, the class will be run in as participatory manner as possible.   I encourage questions and the “lectures” will be interspersed with individual and group activities.  In addition, Fridays will be devoted to group work and student presentations.  All of this classroom activity is meant to give the students the maximum amount of assisted practice in reading, writing, and verbally communicating mathematics. This is not a class on “topics in mathematics.”  Rather, it is more of a study of the language of mathematics.  Mathematics has a grammar and vocabulary, and there is no way to master this language without practice.  As a result, it is mandatory that students attend each and every class meeting, are punctual, and keep up to date with homework. (Please see below for policies on class attendance, missed exams, and late homework.)

There is a moodle page for this class. That is where you will find the schedule, notes, and all homework assignments.

## Policies on class attendance, exams, and homework:

**Attendance**: 
Attendance in this class is mandatory every day.  Absences must be excused with written verification (e.g. doctor’s note), or arranged in advance (e.g. athletic event or musical performance).

**Mini-tests**:  
The mini-tests will be on Wednesdays and will take approximately 10-15 minutes.  Only in extreme circumstances, and with a written excuse (e.g. doctor or police report) will make-up exams be given.  These must be taken the following Monday. 

The mini-tests will be graded on an 0-3 scale: 0 for less than half correct, 3 for perfect, 2 for correct with trivial errors, 1 for having the idea without follow through.  The topics will concern basic subject skills (e.g. finding the contrapositive to a statement, proving set inclusions, doing induction) that you must be able to perform perfectly to pass this class.  You will be able to repeat any mini-test ONCE (with a different problem) and it must be on the following Monday  (during my office hours).  

**Homework**: 
Assignments will be posted on the course moodle.  This class is about communicating mathematics. The main tool I will use to evaluate your progress will be your homework.  Therefore, I encourage you to take it very seriously.

1. Homework will be due on Wednesdays in class.  It will cover material up through the previous Wednesday’s lecture, so you should start then. 
2. Homework may be worked on in groups of 2-3.  In fact this is encouraged.  However each student must turn in his or her own write up and it must represent his or her own ideas.  
3. Any homework that is two days late will be marked down by 10%, any homework later than 2 days late will not be accepted.  
4. Your lowest two homework assignments will be dropped.   Please save these for emergencies.  
5. Each homework assignment will be worth 20 points:  3 problems (6 points each) will be graded thoroughly; plus 2 points per homework for following the 

  **Rules for homework**:

  1. Homework must be complete, neatly written, and clearly presented.  
  2. It should be stapled. No spiral notebook paper. 
  3. Your name, my name, and the due date must appear clearly in the upper right hand side of the front page.
  4. I must be able to follow your work and have room to comment on each problem.  Rewrite or summarize each problem. 
  5. Write in complete sentences, which are geared towards your fellow student. Do not rely on the expertise of the reader (I will take everything you say literally). 
  6. When computing, indicate what your calculations are trying to accomplish. 
  7. When proving a statement, lead the reader carefully through the logical argument.

**Journals**: 
Along with the weekly homework assignment students will turn in a weekly math journal.  This should be typed on the computer and uploaded to Moodle each Monday by 9am.  It should be no longer than one page and no less than ½ page.

**It should cover one or more of the following**:

1. A summary of the last weeks lecture 
2. A description of a homework or group work problem that the student could NOT solve
3. An issue or concern regarding the content or pedagogy of the class. 
4. Good programs to use for math editing are LaTeX and MS word with the equation editor.
